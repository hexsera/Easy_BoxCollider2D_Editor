<h1>Easy BoxCollider 2D Editor for Pixel Art</h1>

[This text was translated with the help of AI.]

This tool was created to make it easier to adjust BoxCollider2D sizes for pixel art in Unity. <br>
You can install it either by <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/upm-ui-giturl.html">adding the package via Git URL in Unity</a> or by downloading it from the Unity Asset Store(coming soon!). 

This package has been tested on Unity Editor versions 2021.3, 2022.3, and 6000.0. <br>
It is recommended to use Unity 2021.3 or newer, as earlier versions may not work properly.
